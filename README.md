# RDM Maturity Model

The **Research Data Management (RDM) Maturity Model** is a framework designed to assess the capabilities of institutions in managing research data effectively.
It provides a structured approach to evaluate various aspects of RDM practices, helping organizations identify strengths and areas for improvement.

The model is organized into several domains, each representing a key area of research data management:
* Strategy and sustainability
* Legal aspects
* Support and training
* Data and metadata management


The RDM Maturity Model is a product of the [RDM Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/research-data-management)
of the European life sciences infrastructure [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/).
